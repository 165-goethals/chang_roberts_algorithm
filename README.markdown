# Chang-Roberts distributed algorithm implementation #

This project is the implementation of the ChangRoberts distributed algorithm which is used as an election algorithm to find a process with the largest identification number.
It is a useful method of election in decentralised distributed computing.

To find more details about the algorithm please refer to the following URL for a comprehensive explanation:

In this project the algorithm has been implemented in Java using two network communication models:
* Sockets
* RMI
